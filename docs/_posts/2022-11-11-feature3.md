# Octave extension

To extend the piano's octave range we added the necessary note values to the array containing the frequencies that are played.


```javascript

hardcoded_frequencies = [523.25, 554.37,  587.33, 622.25,  659.25,  698.46,  739.99,  783.99,  830.61,  880.00,  932.33,  987.77, 1046.50, 1108.73, 1174.66, 1244.51, 1318.51, 1396.91, 1479.98, 1567.98, 1661.22, 1760.00, 1864.66, 1975.53]

```

We then associated the newly created keys to the corresponding note present in the array.
